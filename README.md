## Week 08 - Plotting Data
This program creates one figure that plots two data sets: (1) a histogram of the normal distribution of 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2 adn (2) a line showing h(x) = x^3

The program uses numpy to call normal distribution data for the histogram

: Project Title
2: Project Description
- What the program/application is going does
- Why you used certain codes (similar to the comments in the file - explain why you wrote it that way - shows you understand what code you used too)
- What was difficult and what you would like to add in the future.
3: Table of Contents (only if its very long code - eg: End of Semester Project)
4: How to Run or Install the code - we dont need this probably until later
5: How to use the code - Screenshots of the program running eg: picture of the code and what it results in
6: References - any links from what you found when googling for help with code or when looking to see how things are coded. - Even qualified programmers/data analysts google a lot, and were not being told how to do everything because they're trying to teach us how to research as well.
